# Task 0 - C Programming Exercises

This directory contains a series of C programming exercises from Operation System class. The exercises are authored by Yanga Rubushe. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of C programming, including variable handling, memory addresses, pointer arithmetic, and function usage.

## Exercise 1 - p1.c

In this exercise, the program demonstrates the use of different data types in C, including integers, characters, and doubles. It also illustrates how to use pointers to access the memory addresses of these variables. The program prints the values of the variables along with their addresses and the size of each data type in bytes.

### Key Features:
- Declaration and initialization of variables of different types.
- Use of pointers to access and print variable values and addresses.
- Demonstration of memory size for each data type.

## Exercise 2 - p2.c

This exercise focuses on local variables and their memory addresses within functions. It defines two functions, `foo1` and `foo2`, which take integer parameters and print the addresses and values of local variables. The program highlights the concept of stack memory and the independence of local variables.

### Key Features:
- Definition of functions with local variables.
- Printing of variable addresses and values.
- Explanation of stack memory allocation and variable independence.

## Exercise 3 - p3.c

In this exercise, the program explores pointer arithmetic with different data types (char, int, and double). It demonstrates how incrementing a pointer affects its address and shows the importance of understanding memory allocation in C.

### Key Features:
- Pointer arithmetic with char, int, and double types.
- Printing of memory addresses before and after pointer increment.
- Caution against dereferencing pointers that point to unallocated memory.

## Conclusion

These exercises provide a foundational understanding of C programming concepts, particularly in relation to memory management and the use of pointers. They serve as a practical introduction to handling variables and understanding how data is stored and accessed in memory.
