# Java Binary Search Tree and Car Class

This project contains implementations of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a simple Car class in Java. The project includes three main files:

1. **Car.java**: A class representing a car with properties and methods.
2. **ordertransival.java**: A class that implements a Binary Search Tree with post-order traversal.
3. **bst.java**: A class that implements a Binary Search Tree with in-order traversal.

## File Descriptions

### 1. Car.java

This file defines a `Car` class with the following properties:
- `make`: The manufacturer of the car.
- `model`: The model of the car.
- `year`: The year the car was manufactured.

The class includes a method `startEngine()` that prints a message indicating that the engine has started.

**Usage:**
To run the `Car` class, compile and execute the file:


### 2. ordertransival.java

This file implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the following features:
- Insertion of positive integers.
- Post-order traversal of the tree.

The program prompts the user to enter positive numbers and displays the post-order traversal of the BST after the input is complete.

**Usage:**
To run the `ordertransival` class, compile and execute the file:

### 3. bst.java

This file implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the following features:
- Insertion of positive integers.
- In-order traversal of the tree.

The program inserts a set of predefined integers into the BST and displays the in-order traversal of the tree.

**Usage:**
To run the `bst` class, compile and execute the file:


## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- A terminal or command prompt to compile and run the Java files.
